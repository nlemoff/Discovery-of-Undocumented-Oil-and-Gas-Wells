# Discovery of Undocumented Oil and Gas Wells

## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to the results of a collaborative project I was involved in at Berkeley Lab during the Fall 2023 semester, conducted through the UC Berkeley Data Science Discovery Program. Our work focused on the development of advanced methods to identify undocumented oil and gas wells in the United States using historical topographic maps.

## Project Background
In the U.S., oil and gas extraction has been a significant industry since the 1850s, resulting in the drilling of approximately 3.7 million wells. However, it is estimated that around 800,000 of these wells are undocumented. These undocumented wells are a concern for environmental and public health safety, as they pose risks of methane leaks and contamination of underground freshwater aquifers.

## My Contribution: "Optimizing the Computer Vision Process"
I was responsible for the section titled "Optimizing the Computer Vision Process". My work contributed significantly to enhancing the precision and efficiency of the computer vision neural network algorithm used in this project.

### Key Aspects of My Work:
- **On-the-Fly Augmentation Implementation**: I incorporated dynamic on-the-fly augmentation during the training phase of the model. This technique enriches the dataset by simulating a diverse range of scenarios without requiring additional storage, enabling the model to generalize more effectively to new, unseen data.
- **Bagging and Boosting Ensemble Techniques**: I applied two key ensemble techniques: bagging and boosting. Bagging involves training multiple models on varied subsets of the data and averaging their predictions to reduce variance and overfitting. Boosting, on the other hand, sequentially trains models where each new model focuses on correcting the errors of the previous one, significantly enhancing accuracy. The ongoing efforts aim to merge the strengths of both techniques for optimal results.

## Project Significance
This project plays a crucial role in addressing the environmental and health risks posed by undocumented oil and gas wells. Our advancements in computer vision and data processing methodologies not only aid in mitigating these risks but also have potential applications in other areas where similar challenges exist.
